# dotfiles
I learned about dotfiles at [dotfiles.eieio.xyz](https://www.udemy.com/course/dotfiles-from-start-to-finish-ish/learn/lecture/23828240#overview), and so can you!

## TODO
- Terminal Preferances (and iterm?)
- Changed shell to ZSH
- Dock Prefs
- Mission Control Prefs (do I have these?)
- Finder show path bar
- Trackpad (am I using the defaults?)
- Git (Config and SSH)
- bat zshrc could be more colorful

- this is a test
